# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project aims to predict the heart disease in individuals based on various medical factors using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a dataset containing attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant features, the goal is to develop accurate predictive models that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention of heart diseases.

## Lessons Learned

One of the significant challenges was dealing with missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies that could affect the performance of the predictive models. To overcome this, I implemented robust data preprocessing techniques such as imputation for missing values, outlier detection and removal, and normalization or scaling of features to ensure the data's quality.
